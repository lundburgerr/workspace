In the MIPS32 architecture, all machine code instructions are represented as 32-bit instructions.
The goal of this lab is to write a \emph{disassembler} in \emph{C} that turns these machine code instructions into MIPS32 assembly language.
The program should read a file as input that contains the instructions in decimal or hexadecimal---one in each row---for the MIPS32-program. For every line in the machine code file; the disassembler should output a line that contains the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item the original instruction.
\item the type of instruction.
\item the values for relevant fields for that type of instruction in both decimal and hexadecimal.
\item and the mnemonic representation.
\end{itemize}

The disassembler should handle all instructions, except floating point instructions.
If the instruction is not valid the program should output relevant information for that line.

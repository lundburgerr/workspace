The PSD does not output the position of the maximum intensity; but a rather a moving average of the intensity on the entire PSD. 
So that if any external light hit the PSD; the position output may be erroneous if it is not evenly 
distributed over PSD---this can be avoided by removing external light sources.

Since we wanted as large magnification as possible, the PSD were placed close to $90^\circ$
to the movement of the tuning fork. This made the the scattered beam from the tuning fork around the maximum intensity asymmetric. This implies that the PSD will return a position that is shifted.
A way to handle this problem could have been to use an aperture stop. 
Because of the calibration. This problem did not significantly disturb our measurement.

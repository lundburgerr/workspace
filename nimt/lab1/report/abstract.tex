%1. What did we do??
In this lab we measured the amplitude and frequency characteristics of a tuning fork.
%2. experimental design
We did this by using the laser triangulation technique with a \emph{position sensitive detector} (PSD)
that collects scattered light from the laser that hit the tuning fork.
%3. results
The measured frequency using this laser triangulation method was $253.68Hz$ which deviates $0.9\%$
from the value of $256Hz$ specified by the manufacturer.
%4. Conclusions
We think that these results confirm that the laser triangulation technique using a PSD is good for measuring movements in the $\mu m$-range at frequencies of several hundred hertz.

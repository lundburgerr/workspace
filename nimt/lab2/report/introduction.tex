%1. The problem in general: determine movement, what methods is there. Mention non-invasive

%2. Describe how laser triangulation works

%3. How good is laser triangulation today? accuracy etc.


%4. Other applications

%5. Limitations


%6. Our specific problem

In this experiment we will make use of electromagnetic induction to detect cracks in an electrically conductive material. In particular, we will measure the change in the (complex) voltage in a suitable probe when scanning the surface of the investigated material. We will design such a probe ourselves before starting the actual experiment. Moreover, we will determine the resistivity of a brass sample by the same method (called Eddy Current Testing).

\subsection{Crack Detection}
With our set up, we are able to detect cracks in an electrically conductive material, as was the main goal of the experiment. At higher frequencies ($f>20$ kHz), the behaviour of the probe impedance deviates from theoretical considerations for ferromagnetic materials. While the deviation of the reactance can be interpreted by the sample loosing its ferromagnetic properties, the anomaly of the resistance could not be satisfyingly explained.

\subsection{Resistivity Measurement}
With this set up we believe that you can make accurate measurements of resistivity. A better model is needed
and we think this can be derived from \cite{deedsdodd}.

%1. The problem in general: determine velocities
The main issue in this lab is how to measure the velocity of a moving object in a non-invasive manner.
%2. Describe how laser ToF works
This can be solved by using a laser \emph{time of flight} (ToF) method where two light sensors are aimed at by two different laser beams which are separated by a known distance. When an object crosses these laser beams; light sensors will register these events. Knowing the difference in time between these events for both sensors and the spatial distance between them---you can calculate the velocity.

%3. How good is laser ToF today? accuracy etc. and limitations
The accuracy of the laser ToF method is largely limited by the sensitivity of the light sensor and 
the sampling frequency of the \emph{analog to digital converter} (ADC).
It is also limited by how small the distance between the laser beams is, and by the calibration method that is used to determine this distance.

%4. Other applications
%TODO

%6. Our specific problem
The goal of this lab was to measure the decay of energy of a pendulum using this laser ToF method.
The pendulum has two sources of energy loss: friction and air drag. We examined the characteristics of both these contributions by a comparison of the measured data with a theoretical model.

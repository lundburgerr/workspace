%More/better theory, fit data to theory?
Eq. (\ref{eq:fullshort}) and (\ref{eq:air}) worked very well as a model for the damping of the pendulum, but we also believe that the numerical solution of eq. (\ref{eq:full}) would fit the data even better. However due to time and knowledge constraints we did not try to fit our data to this model.

%Better pendulum
To eliminate the unknown factor of the pendulum we could simply use a better pendulum that is more
constrained to movement around one axis.

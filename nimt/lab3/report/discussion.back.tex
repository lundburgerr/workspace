%Explain why more mass -> less damping
The pendulum motion is not entirely constrained to be around the joint axis, but it will wobble along this direction aswell; we believe that the loss of energy due to this may be greater than the frictional energy loss---and when we add mass, this loss of energy actually decreases which might explain the weird result where the damping of the energy is \emph{lower} when mass is added.

%Explain why theory bla bla

%Calibration
Calculations of the separation $d$ between the beams where the pendulum passes by was not accurate enough
for the method ??. We did not try method ?? but we think this will be more accurate.

To get better results we need to determine the temperature distribution much better.
One problem was that the thermistors only measured the temperature at three points on the surface of the metal. Then we assumed that the temperature gradient was linear between the measured points and that the temperature was the same in the core of the rod as on the surface. We don't have any error estimate of how large this error might be and if it might explain why the results did not correspond with tabulated values.

%1. What did we do??
We measured the thermal expansion coefficient of two different metal rods in order to determine what metal it is.
%2. experimental design
In order to do this we used a Michelson interferometer to measure the expansion of the metal rod and thermistors to measure the temperature of the rod at three points on its surface.

%3. The results were
The metal rods was measured to have a thermal expansion coefficient of $26.605 \cdot 10^{-6} \pm 0.416 \cdot 10^{-6} \; \rm{1/K}$ and $19.371 \cdot 10^{-6} \pm 0.110 \cdot 10^{-6} \; \rm{1/K}$.
But we think the true values should have been $23\cdot10^{-6} \rm{1/K}$ and $8.6\cdot10^{-6} \rm{1/K}$
and correspond to aluminium and titanium respectively. So the results were not better than an order of magnitude estimate.
%4. What can we do better, conclusions.
In order to make more accurate measurements we believe we need a better way to measure the temperature of the rod and a better model for how the temperature is distributed in the rod.

The RN_sim project is defined in Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express.

Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express must be installed to run the simulation, 
it is free but requires registration.

At least two RN_sim projects can communicate, through UDP ports (IP 127.0.0.1) configured with
a command argument in the "properties/Configuration Properties/Debugging/Command Arguments" menu.

One project shall be given Command Argument 0 and the other Command Argument 1.

A terminal program communicating through UDP must also be used, one per application. 
YAT (Yet Another Terminal) has been used for this purpose. 

The application exchanges text strings with the terminal program as follows

Configured as 0 : Receives on port 5001, sends on port 5002
Configured as 1 : Receives on port 5003, sends on port 5004
 
Through the terminal the application can e.g be defined as master and slave through commands.
